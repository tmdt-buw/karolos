# Getting Started

run minimal trainer config

This framework uses Pytorch applied to Pybullet simulation environments
composed of a robot and a task which can be arbitrarily combined.
Run the minimal configuration with an algorithm and task/robot combination of your choice.
If you have limited resources, Soft-Actor-Critic with reach task on pandas robot 
should converge after about 5 Million steps to a successful policy.
See architecture doc for further description of the components and contributing 
if you'd like to contribute a feature, robot, task or new agent.
