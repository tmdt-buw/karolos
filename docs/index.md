# KAROLOS

__KAROLOS__ (Open-Source Robot-Task Learning Simulation) is an open-source simulation and reinforcement learning suite.

KAROLOS was developed with a focus on:

- __scalability__: As reinforcement learning algorithms require significant amounts of experience,
KAROLOS enables the parallelization of environments.
This way, you spend less time on data collection and more time on training and prototyping.

-  __modularization__: More and more research in reinforcement learning is looking into the transfer of agents from one environment to another.
KAROLOS was developed to quickly generate environments with different robot-task combinations.

KAROLOS is still under active development. We encourage you check back regularly.
